A RungeKuttaStepper is a specialization on Explicit Stepper that provides a higer order estimate. The Euler method implemented in ExplicitStepper is order 1, and the error obtained is proportional to the step size.

The RungeKuttaStepper is order 4, the error term is proportional to the step size to the fourth power.
